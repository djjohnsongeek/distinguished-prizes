THOUGHT:
should the admin app be completely seperate from the public page?

4. allow sign ups (add recaptia)
    - ipquality score to verify email addresses
        - ENV config to only check this in production env
5. finish winner selection logic
    - email winner with id and guid
    - link opens form to fill in address information
    - email site owner with address information
    - setup "queue" on site

6. update file name when selecting files (for edit and create)
7. auto form errors on register forms (same as sweepstakes create/edit form)
5. implement lockout feature for failed logins
6. show past prizes (with the winners)
7. update number of current participants
6. store an email list for new giveaways?
7. design and content (faq, ect ...)
